# Monte Carlo Tree Search
This repo provides an implementation for MCTS algorithm.
We provide a solid interface for other perfect-information games too.
Although, we believe that for the rollout, domain-specific heuristics could be more useful.

Change the logger level in main.py to DEBUG so that you learn more about how the algorithm works.

MCTS came into prominence after DeepMind's AlphaGo utilized it to beat 
Lee Sedol, Go's world champion at the time.
